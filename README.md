# rbdl-orb-examples
A set of examples to accompany rbdl-orb to give you a detailed tour of the tools and background literature of RBDL

To get started:

1. Read the INSTALL.txt
    You probably have to install something as all of the examples make use
    of the rbdl-orb repo that is on Git. 
     
2. Each example contains a README.md which contains instructions to run the 
   example, a tour through the code, and literature references (when 
   appropriate, and sparingly used).

If you are trying RBDL for the first time, consider going through the 
examples in this order:

1. pendulum
2. constrainedDoublePendulum
3. bouncingBall
4. walkingInverseDynamicsWithPython

The quaternionJoint has not yet been added, but it will be sometime in 
the spring of 2019.
