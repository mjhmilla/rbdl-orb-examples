Quick Start
================================================================================

This simple example reads in a pendulum model, described in 
model/pendulum_luamodel.lua, uses rbdl to compute its state derivative, and
uses Boost to numerically integrate its movements. To get started

1. Make a 'build' folder here

2. Run cmake from the 'build' folder. You will be asked to set CUSTOM_RBDL_PATH,
   which is the path to the install folder of the version of RBDL that you 
   would like to use. 

    If you have a system-wide installation of RBDL this folder is '/usr/local'

3. From a terminal in the build directory call 
    make

4. From a terminal in the build directory run

    ./pendulumForwardDynamics

5. If everything works you should see a bunch of data printed to the screen and
   2 files written to the output folder. See the 'Example Output' section for
  an example.

6. To view an animation, from a terminal in the 'pendulum' folder run

  meshup model/pendulum.lua output/meshup.csv

Detailed Code Tour

Before getting started be aware:
  
  Time commitment: 
    30-45 minutes

1. RBDL is a C++ implementation of Roy Featherstone's recursive order-n 
   algorithms which makes use of spatial vectors. If you are going to be using
   RBDL you should consider reading the following papers

  Featherstone R. A beginner's guide to 6-d vectors (part 1). IEEE robotics 
  & automation magazine. 2010 Sep;17(3):83-94.

  Featherstone R. A beginner's guide to 6-D vectors (part 2)[tutorial]. IEEE 
  robotics & automation magazine. 2010 Dec;17(4):88-99.

  In Proceedings 2000 ICRA. Millennium Conference. IEEE International Conference 
  on Robotics and Automation. Symposia Proceedings (Cat. No. 00CH37065) 2000 
  (Vol. 1, pp. 826-834). IEEE.

2. The geometric, inertia, and toplogy properties of the rigid-body model of
   a pendulum are stored in model/pendulum.lua. Have a look through it and
   see if you can answer these questions:

   a. Using the identityMatrix, is the inertia of the pendulum about the Z axis?

   b. The 'joint_frame' locates the location of the joint frame in the 
      coordinates of the parent frame. Using the 'parent' and 'joint_frame'
      entries figure out where the pendulum's revolute joint is located 
      in the ROOT frame

   c. Many quantities in RBDL make use of Featherstone's spatial mathematics.
      A spatial vector has 6 elements: the first 3 correspond to
      rotations about the x,y, and z axis; the second 3 correspond to 
      translations about the x,y, and z axis. Look closely at the 'joint' tag:
      what axis is the pendulum rotating about?

3. The code that reads in the lua model and integrates its state forward in
  time is src/pendulumForwardDynamics.cc. Open it. All of the comments
  below appear in that file - just search for '3a', for example to find
  the first comment in this guided tour:

  3a. The Lua model is read in here, and turned into a series of 
      vectors and matricies in model which RBDL uses to evaluate 
      dynamics quantities

  3b. Here we instantiate a wrapper class which is needed so that 
      Boost can evaluate the state derivative of the model.

  3c. Boost uses this 'operator()' function to evaluate the state
      derivative of the pendulum.

  3d. Here we split out q (generalized positions) and qd 
      (generalized velocities) from the x (state vector)

  3e. Here we set the applied generalized forces to zero

  3f. RBDL's ForwardDynamics function is used to evaluate
      qdd (generalized accelerations)

  3g. Here qd, and qdd are used to populate dxdt 
      (the state derivative)    

  3h. Here we integrate forward in time between a series of nPts from
      t0 to t1

  3i. At each point the state, kinetic (ke), and potential energy (pe) 
      is evaluated. In this conservative system the sum of kinetic and
      potential energy should be constant. Any error that accumulates
      is due to the cumulation of integration error.      
  
  3j. Now the data we have accumulated is written to file

Quick CMake Tour
================================================================================

If you are also new to CMake and have just started using it this tutorial is
for you. This is a very basic introduction. CMake is a large tool that has
excellent documentation. When you get stuck refer to the documentation online.
If the documentation is not answering your question, look for other example
files.

Before getting started be aware:
  
  Time commitment: 
    30-45 minutes


What is CMake? 
  From the webpage (https://cmake.org/)
  CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, 
  test and package software. 

What skills do I need to develop with CMake?
  
  1. Build software: If you have gotten this far you have succeeded. This will
     not be covered in any more detail here.

  2. Write CMakeLists.txt files: If you will be writing your own C++ programs.    
     Open CMakeLists.txt to see what a basic CMakeLists file looks like. Look
     for the comments below the in the CMakeLists.txt file - these cover the 
     basic things you will most often need to do in your CMakeLists.txt file:

    2a. Give the project to build a name 

    2b. Specify a minimum version of CMake to use: this is important! When you
        write your own CMakeLists.txt files insert you own version number 
        of CMake here.

    2c. Assign the names of the programs/libraries that you wish to build
        to a list called 'TARGETS'

    2d. Add the folder 'CMake' & 'CMake/Modules' to be included: these contain
        project-specific CMake files. If you open the folder 'CMake' you 
        should find two files which have been written to find Eigen3 and 
        RBDL with the following names.

          FindEigen3.cmake  
          FindRBDL.cmake

        Note: the $ is used to tell CMake to resolve a variable into a string.
        Thus ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} will turn into the path to the project
        source directory.

    2e. Tell CMake what packages are needed to build this software and 
        have it try to find these dependencies. The output of this process
        is several variables in CMake that define where the libraries and
        header files are located for each package. To see what these 
        variables are called you need to look at the 'Find ... .cmake' file
        for this package, or look for the package control (*.pc file) for this 
        package. A bit more on this later.

        -FIND_PACKAGE( )
         This is a command that CMake provides which will search likely, and
         recommended locations, for a specific library in a manner that works
         on any operating system. When possible use these commands exclusively.

        -SET(CUSTOM_RBDL_PATH "" CACHE PATH "Path to specific RBDL Installation")
         The variable CUSTOM_RBDL_PATH is used in combination with 
         CMake/FindRBDL.cmake to find a specific installation of RBDL


    2f. Tell CMake where the header files (these are folders that have header 
        files). Here there is a mixture of methods used:

        INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES ( 
          ${RBDL_INCLUDE_DIR} 
          ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR} 
          ${LUA_INCLUDE_DIR}
          ${BOOST_INC_DIR} 
        )        

        The variables RBDL_INCLUDE_DIR and EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR are variables
        that are set by the CMake/FindRBDL.cmake and CMake/FindEigen3.cmake 
        files. To know what variables you have to work with you need to open
        these files and have a look at them.

        The variable BOOST_INC_DIR is manually set, and hardcoded to /usr/local.
        While this is quick and easy to do it is not recommended: the person
        using this CMake file may have put the Boost installation somewhere
        else. Further, this path is not cross-platform: Windows does not have
        a /usr/local file. If this is running on your own machine it does not
        matter a great deal what you do. If you want to contribute this to
        a cross-platform code this would be a big problem.


    2g. Tell CMake what executable(s) you want to build (the Targets naturally)
        and what files are needed to build the software

    2h. Tell CMake what libraries are used at runtime. Here the pendulum makes
        use of 4 libraries (*.so files on Ubuntu): the library of the pendulum,
        the main rbdl library, the rbdl-lua library, and the lua libraries. 
        If you open /orbGitHubCode/rbdl-orb-release-install/lib you can see
        the various libraries that were made during the build process

          librbdl_geometry.so        
          librbdl_luamodel.so.2.6.0  
          librbdl.so
          librbdl_geometry.so.2.6.0  
          librbdl_muscle.so          
          librbdl.so.2.6.0
          librbdl_luamodel.so        
          librbdl_muscle.so.2.6.0    

        If you look closely at the sizes and file types you should see that
        some files are actual libraries (e.g. librbdl_geometry.so.2.6.0) while 
        others are just links to libraries (e.g. librbdl_geometry.so) which 
        take up much less memory.

        As before the variables RBDL_LIBRARY, RBDL_LUAMODEL_LIBRARY, and 
        LUA_LIBRARIES are all variables that have been set in the respective
        'Find ... .cmake' files that exist for each of these packages

    2i. Optional: Echo information back to the user. I have many versions of 
        RBDL on my machine. To ensure that CMake is using the correct library
        here the paths to the include files and libraries of RBDL are printed
        to the screen.


  3. Write/debug/use FindXXXX.cmake files: These are files that are found in
     the CMake folder of this directory which can be used to help CMake find
     libraries. To see an example open CMake/FindRBDL.cmake

     3a. This file is going to look for rbdl, rbdl-luamodel, rbdl-urdfreader,
         rbdl-geometry, and rbdl-muscle. Here we make a bunch of boolean flags
         to indicate if these resources have been found and initialize them 
         to false.

     3b. All of the variables that this FindRBDL.cmake file will populate, 
         if these resources exist, are listed here.


     3c. This script has two different modes:

        If there is a CUSTOM_RBDL_PATH: then this path is used to search 
        for Rbdl

        If there is no CUSTOM_RBDL_PATH, then a bunch of typical install
        locations are used. Note that at the present time these typical install
        include paths that will only work on linux

     3d. The validity of each path is checked by using the FIND_PATH 
         command to look for a specific file. In the case of the 
         RBDL_INCLUDE_DIR, this variable gets assigned the path of 
         ${CUSTOM_RBDL_PATH}/include if CMake can find rbdl/rbdl.h from
        ${CUSTOM_RBDL_PATH}/include.

     3e. Similarly the validity of a path to a library is checked by looking
         to see if a specific library exists using the FIND_LIBRARY command.
         Note that you do not need to put the file type on the end of the 
         library name, nor a prefix of 'lib': CMake will do this for you 
         in a way that is cross-platform.

     3f. If there is no CUSTOM_RBDL_PATH given then FIND_PATH and FIND_LIBRARY
         commands are used but with substantial HINTS, or places to look

     3g. If we've gotten to this point then either all include directories 
         and libraries have been found, some have been found, or none have 
         been found. All of the code below is going through what the user
         asked for, seeing if it was found, and if not issuing an error.
                
     3h. Here all of the specific paths and libraries are marked as advanced
         which means that they will not appear in the CMake gui unless the 
         user toggles to the advanced mode.
